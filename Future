## The Legal Debate Over Prediction Market Operators in the US

### 1. Current Regulatory Landscape & Legalization Debate

Prediction markets, especially those offering real-money contracts on elections, sports, and other events, sit at a legal crossroads in the United States. Their regulation—historically uncertain and fragmented—has come to the fore in 2025 due to federal and state actions, shifting agency attitudes, and active litigation.

- **Federal vs. State Authority:** Federally regulated prediction markets (like Kalshi and, soon, Polymarket via acquisition of QCX) operate under Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight. This permits them to list event-based contracts under the Commodity Exchange Act. However, state-level gambling commissions and Native American tribal gaming authorities have challenged their operations, especially when contracts touch on sports or politics[1][2].
- **CFTC’s Shifting Stance:** Under the Trump administration, the CFTC has moved toward a more innovation-friendly approach, becoming less aggressive in challenging prediction market contracts. Recent public roundtables and court decisions have favored openness to new event types—including sports and political outcomes—but the agency still faces significant legal and constitutional questions, especially around the "gaming or betting" interpretation of key regulations like 40.11[1][2].
- **Key Lawsuits:** Kalshi and other operators have fought cease-and-desist orders in states such as Maryland, Nevada, and New Jersey, arguing that federal preemption allows their contracts nationwide. The issue is complicated by state anti-gambling laws and tribal sovereignty, which can override or challenge federal oversight.

### 2. Taxation and Legality: The Financial Stakes

- **Taxation Uncertainty:** Prediction markets regulated by the CFTC are currently distinct from sportsbooks for tax purposes. They are *not* subject to high excise taxes on sports wagers, unlike traditional sportsbooks—an advantage that has attracted interest from companies such as DraftKings and Robinhood. However, the IRS is actively reviewing whether sports event contracts should be taxed as gambling, as happened with daily fantasy sports in 2020. If contracts are taxed as futures, they benefit from favorable "mark-to-market" rules; if deemed wagers, each trade could be subject to a federal excise tax (0.25% for legal wagers, 2% for illegal)[3].
- **Legal Gray Zones:** A court decision or regulatory ruling classifying prediction market contracts as sports betting would trigger broader taxes and potentially limit nationwide offering. The line between commodities trading and gambling is blurry, and legal precedent could shift practices quickly—making policy risk a key factor for all operators and investors[4][3][5].
- **State Pushback:** Some states are seeking to tax or limit prediction markets, worried about lost revenue from sportsbooks and possible competition. Tribal gaming authorities also see them as threats to sovereign gaming compacts.

### 3. The Future Outlook: Upside & Downside Risks

#### Upsides
- **Market Expansion:** Federal regulation could make prediction markets accessible nationwide, bypassing restrictive state-by-state licensing and rapidly growing the market (see chart below).
- **Integration with Brokerages and Sportsbooks:** Partnerships (e.g., Robinhood with Kalshi, DraftKings with Railbird) unlock new customer segments, institutional legitimacy, and broader financial product synergies.
- **Favorable Tax Treatment:** If classified as commodities/futures, operators and participants benefit from lower taxes compared to sportsbook wagers.
- **Product Diversity:** Ability to offer trading on non-sports events (politics, entertainment, economics) not allowed under sportsbook regulations—providing new avenues for speculation and hedging[6].

#### Downsides & Risks
- **Legal Uncertainty:** Active legal challenges from states and tribal gaming groups could limit or even ban some event types, particularly sports and election markets.
- **Regulatory Reversal:** Future CFTC leadership or Congressional action could reclassify prediction markets as gambling, imposing new taxes, restrictions, or prohibitions.
- **State Taxation:** States might succeed in asserting authority, leading to higher wager taxes and loss of the current competitive advantage for prediction markets.
- **Consumer Protection & Fairness:** Concerns about speculative risk, manipulation, and social impact could lead to tighter rules, limiting innovation.

### 4. Policymaker Positions

- **Pro-Innovation Voices:** The Trump-era CFTC, some federal legislators, and regulatory advocates (like Brian Quintenz) push for lighter-touch federal oversight and broader legitimization, seeing prediction markets as new vehicles for price discovery and risk management[1][2][5].
- **Opposition:** Some lawmakers (e.g., Sen. Schiff, Sen. Booker), state gaming commissions, and tribal groups warn of gambling risks, market manipulation, and lost state revenues, seeking stronger restrictions[7][2].
- **Industry Response:** Operators are lobbying for federal preemption, clear guidance, and favorable tax rulings. They argue for the societal benefits of accurate forecasting and financial innovation.

## Conclusion

The future of prediction market operators in the US is promising but faces notable policy risk. If federal agencies and courts continue their pro-innovation stance, operators like Kalshi, Polymarket, Robinhood, and Railbird could see exponential growth, nationwide reach, and integration with mainstream finance. However, downside risks from regulatory reversals, increased taxation, and state/tribal opposition remain unresolved. Tax and legality will continue to shape business models, product offerings, and industry expansion—making ongoing legal, legislative, and agency developments crucial to watch[1][2][3][4][5][6].
